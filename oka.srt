1
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,061
Ofcourse l've seen herfilms...

2
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,532
andalways thought
she was, well, fabulous.

3
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:31,543
But, you know, a million, million miles
from the worldllive in...

4
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:36,275
which is here, Notting Hill,
my favorite bit ofLondon.

5
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:40,447
There's the market on weekdays selling
everyfruit and vegetable known to man.

6
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:43,688
Rock-hard bananas,
five for a pound !

7
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:46,529
The tattooparlor
with aguy outside whogot drunk...

8
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:50,060
andnowcan't remember
why he chose "l love Ken. "

9
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,231
The radicalhairdressers...

10
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:54,532
where everyone comes out
looking like the Cookie Monster,

11
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:56,873
whetherthey want to ornot.

12
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,034
Andthen, suddenly,
it's the weekend,

13
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:01,775
andfrom break ofday hundreds
ofstalls appearout ofnowhere,

14
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:04,546
filling Portobello Road,
right up to Notting Hill Gate.

15
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:08,148
And whereveryou look thousands of
people are buying millions ofantiques,

16
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:13,390
somegenuine andsome...
not quitesogenuine.

17
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,162
And what'sgreat is that lots offriends
have endedup in thispart ofLondon.

18
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:20,763
That's Tony, forexample,
architect turnedchef,

19
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:24,285
who recently investedall the money
he everearnedin a newrestaurant.

20
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:27,516
Andso, this is where
lspendmy days andyears...

21
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,417
in this small village in the middle of
the city in a house with a blue door...

22
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:34,859
that my wife andlbought together
before she left me fora man...

23
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:37,690
who lookedexactly like Harrison Ford.

24
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,741
And where lleada strange half-life
with a lodgercalled--

25
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:42,742
Spike !

26
00:03:47,914 --> 00:03:50,945
You couldn't help me with an incredibly
important decision, could you ?

27
00:03:51,055 --> 00:03:55,047
Important compared to, let's say,
whether they cancel Third World debt ?

28
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:58,258
That's right. I am at last going out
on a date with the greatJanine,

29
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,629
and I just wanna be sure
I've picked the right T-shirt.

30
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:03,641
- What are the choices ?
- Well, wait for it.

31
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,265
First there's this one.
Cool, huh ?

32
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:18,737
Yeah, it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note.

33
00:04:18,837 --> 00:04:20,738
Point taken.
Don't despair.

34
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:24,539
If it's romance we're looking for,
I believe I havejust the thing.

35
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:32,693
Yeah, well, there again, she might not
thinkyou had true love on your mind.

36
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:35,784
Right.
Just one more.

37
00:04:41,436 --> 00:04:43,927
True love here lcome.

38
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:53,391
Well, yeah. Yeah, that's--
that's, um, perfect.

39
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:56,452
Great. Thanks.

40
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,824
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

41
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:07,797
Andso it was
just anotherhopeless Wednesday,

42
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,638
asl walkedthe thousandyards
through the market to work,

43
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:15,240
neversuspecting that this was the day
that wasgonna change my life forever.

44
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,781
This is work, by the way,
my little travelbookshop,

45
00:05:19,932 --> 00:05:22,953
- Morning, Martin.
- Morning, Monsignor.

46
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:26,024
which, um, well, sells travelbooks,

47
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:29,506
and, to be frank withyou,
doesn 't always sellmany ofthose.

48
00:05:33,177 --> 00:05:36,709
Classic.
Profit from major sales push,

49
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,950
minus �347.

50
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:45,122
Shall I, uh,
go and get you a cappuccino ?

51
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:48,193
- You know, ease the pain a bit.
- Yeah, yeah.

52
00:05:48,304 --> 00:05:51,365
Better make it a half.
All I can afford.

53
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:56,307
Get your logic.
Demi-cappu coming right up.

54
00:06:20,517 --> 00:06:22,878
Um, can I help you at all ?

55
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:27,590
No, thanks.
I'll just... look around.

56
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,521
Fine.

57
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:40,135
Uh, that book's really not great.

58
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:44,266
Just in case, you know, browsing turned
to buying. You'd be wasting your money.

59
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:46,818
But if it's Turkey
you're interested in,

60
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:49,949
um, this one, on the other hand,
is very good.

61
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:54,251
Um, I think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.

62
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,232
Um, there's also
a very amusing incident with a kebab,

63
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:01,063
um, which is one
of many amusing incidents.

64
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:03,104
Thanks.
I'll think about it.

65
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:05,665
Or, in the biggerhardback variety,
there's--

66
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:09,837
l'm sorry.
Canyoujustgive me a second?

67
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:15,179
Excuse me.

68
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,320
- Yes ?
- Bad news.

69
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,831
What ?

70
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:22,492
We've got a security camera
in this bit ofthe shop.

71
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:23,833
So ?

72
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,634
So I saw you put that book
down your trousers.

73
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:32,206
- What book ?
- The one down your trousers.

74
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,877
I don't have a book
down my trousers.

75
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,958
Right.

76
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:39,319
ltellyou what.
Um, l'll call thepolice, and, um,

77
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,191
if I'm wrong about the whole
"book down the trousers" scenario,

78
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,691
I really apologize.

79
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:50,173
Okay. What if... I did
have a book down my trousers ?

80
00:07:50,244 --> 00:07:53,075
Well, ideally,
when l went back to the desk,

81
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:58,247
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide
to Bali from your trousers...

82
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:01,548
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it.

83
00:08:01,658 --> 00:08:04,019
I'll see you in a sec.

84
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,560
I'm sorry about that.

85
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,151
No, it's fi ne.

86
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:13,103
I was gonna steal one,
but now I've changed my mind.

87
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:16,104
Oh, signed by the author,
I see.

88
00:08:16,214 --> 00:08:18,545
Um, yeah, couldn't stop him.

89
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:21,516
Ifyou can fi nd an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.

90
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:24,578
Excuse me.

91
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,678
- Yes ?
- Can I have your autograph ?

92
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:29,229
Uh, sure.

93
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,022
- What's your name ?
- Rufus.

94
00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:41,735
What does it say ?

95
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:46,877
That's my signature. And above it, it
says, "Dear Rufus, you belong in jail."

96
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:49,048
Good one.

97
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:54,390
- Do you want my phone number ?
- Tempting.

98
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,301
But... no.
Thankyou.

99
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,074
I will take this one.

100
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,615
Oh, right, right.
So, uh--

101
00:09:06,685 --> 00:09:10,747
Well, on second thoughts,
um, maybe it's not that bad after all.

102
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:13,688
Actually, it's a sort
ofa classic, really.

103
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:17,349
None ofthose childish kebab stories
you fi nd in so many books these days.

104
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,360
And, um, I tell you what.

105
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,431
I'll throw in
one ofthose for free.

106
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:24,032
Useful for, uh, lighting fi res,

107
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:27,043
wrapping fish,
that sort ofthing.

108
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:32,475
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.

109
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:08,000
Cappuccino, as ordered.

110
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,091
Thanks.

111
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,262
I don't thinkyou'll believe
who wasjust in here.

112
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:16,213
Who ?
Was it someone famous ?

113
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,876
Would be exciting, though,
wouldn't it,

114
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,287
ifsomeone famous
came into the shop ? Hmm ?

115
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:28,348
Do you know--
and this is pretty amazing, actually--

116
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,689
but I once saw Ringo Starr.

117
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:33,060
- Where was that ?
- Kensington High Street.

118
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,071
At least I think it was Ringo.

119
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:37,872
It might have been that man
from Fiddleron the Roof.

120
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,603
- You know, Toppy.
- Topol.

121
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:43,374
Yes, that's right.
Topol.

122
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:45,385
Mm-hmm.

123
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:49,327
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't--
doesn't look at all like, uh, Topol.

124
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:52,488
Yeah, but he was--
he was quite a long way away from me.

125
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:55,660
So actually it could've
been neither ofthem.

126
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,601
Yes, I suppose so, yes.

127
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:03,113
- It's not a classic anecdote, is it ?
- Not a classic, no. No.

128
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:11,326
- Another one ?
- Yes. No.

129
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:14,857
Let's go crazy.
I'll have an orangejuice.

130
00:11:32,214 --> 00:11:35,216
- Oh, my God !
- Bugger ! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

131
00:11:35,326 --> 00:11:38,157
- Here. Let me--
- Get your hands off !

132
00:11:38,227 --> 00:11:41,028
l'm reallysorry.
l-- llivejust overthestreet.

133
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:44,329
I have, um, water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.

134
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,630
No, thankyou.
I just need to get my car back.

135
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:50,042
I also have a phone.
I'm confident that in five minutes...

136
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,083
we could have you spick-and-span
and back on the street again.

137
00:11:53,183 --> 00:11:55,874
In the non-prostitute sense,
obviously.

138
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:02,187
All right. Well-- What do you mean,
"just over the street" ?

139
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:03,757
- Give it to me in yards.
- Uh, 1 8 yards.

140
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,988
- Give it to me in yards.
- Uh, 1 8 yards.

141
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,320
That's my house there
with the blue front door.

142
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,502
Come on in.
I'll just-- I'll just--

143
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:23,676
Um, right. Right.
Come in.

144
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:27,147
It's, um, not quite as tidy
as it normally is, I fear.

145
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:30,388
But, um--
The bathroom's on the top floor.

146
00:12:30,488 --> 00:12:34,360
And the telephone'sjust--
just up here.

147
00:12:35,901 --> 00:12:38,232
Here.
Let-- Let me, um--

148
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:47,505
Um, round the corner.
Straight on-- straight on up.

149
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,218
Bugger.

150
00:13:14,887 --> 00:13:18,048
Would you like a cup oftea
before you go ?

151
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:20,489
- No.
- Coffee ?

152
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,330
- No.
- Orangejuice ?

153
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,932
Probably not.
Um, something else cold.

154
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:35,145
Coke ? Water ?

155
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:37,146
Some disgusting sugary drink...

156
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:39,317
pretending to have something to do
with fruits ofthe forest ?

157
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,448
- No.
- Would you like something to eat ?

158
00:13:42,528 --> 00:13:44,789
Uh, something to nibble ?

159
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:48,700
Um, apricots soaked in honey ?

160
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,202
Quite why, no one knows, because
it stops them tasting ofapricots...

161
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:54,643
and makes them taste like honey,

162
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:59,675
and ifyou wanted honey, you'd just
buy honey instead of... apricots.

163
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:02,216
Um, but nevertheless,
there we go there.

164
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:04,447
They're yours ifyou want them.

165
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,330
Do you always say "no"
to everything ?

166
00:14:16,742 --> 00:14:19,373
I'd better be going.

167
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,714
Thanks foryour, uh, help.

168
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:24,715
You're welcome.

169
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:30,157
And, uh, may I also say,
um, heavenly.

170
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:33,159
I'll just take
my one chance to say it.

171
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:35,500
Afteryou've read
that terrible book,

172
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,901
you're certainly not going
to be coming back to the shop.

173
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:40,602
Thankyou.

174
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:44,673
Yeah.
Well, my pleasure.

175
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,959
So...

176
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,090
it was nice to meet you.

177
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,431
Surreal but, um-- but nice.

178
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,443
Sorry.

179
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,418
"Surreal but nice" ?
What was I thinking ?

180
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:37,775
- I forgot my other bag.
- Oh, right. Right.

181
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,540
Thanks.

182
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:23,884
I'm very sorry about
the "surreal but nice" comment.

183
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,425
- Disaster.
- That's okay.

184
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:31,257
I thought the apricot and honey thing
was the real low point.

185
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:36,169
Oh, my God.
My flatmate.

186
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:38,900
I'm sorry.
There's no excuse for him.

187
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:45,843
I'm just going into the kitchen
to get some food.

188
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:50,285
Then I'll tell you a story
that will make your balls shrink
to the size of raisins.

189
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:58,798
Probably best
not to tell anyone about this.

190
00:16:58,898 --> 00:17:01,870
Right. Right.
No one.

191
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,241
I mean, I'll tell myselfsometimes.

192
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,942
But don't worry.
I won't believe it.

193
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,141
There's something wrong
with this yogurt.

194
00:17:32,012 --> 00:17:35,143
It's not yogurt.
It's mayonnaise.

195
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,244
Oh, right.
There we are then.

196
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:42,126
On fora videofest tonight ?

197
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:46,668
I got some absolute classics.

198
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,300
- Smile.
- No.

199
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:59,883
- Smile.
- I've got nothing to smile about.

200
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,868
Okay.

201
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:13,569
In about seven seconds,

202
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,340
I'm going to askyou
to marry me.

203
00:18:23,023 --> 00:18:25,584
lmagine.

204
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:30,526
Somewhere in the world
there's a man who's allowedto kiss her.

205
00:18:33,067 --> 00:18:35,768
Yes, she is, uh,

206
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:39,710
fairly fabulous.

207
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,354
- Do you have any books by Dickens ?
- No.

208
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:54,886
No, I'm afraid we're a travel bookshop.
We only sell travel books.

209
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,798
Oh, right. How about
the newJohn Grisham thriller ?

210
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:05,240
Well, no, 'cause that's, uh--
that's a novel too, isn't it ?

211
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,151
Oh, right.

212
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:14,594
Have you got Winnie the Pooh ?

213
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:18,636
Martin, your customer.

214
00:19:18,736 --> 00:19:20,757
Uh, can I help you ?

215
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:42,455
Just, um, incidentally,

216
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:45,527
uh, why...
are you wearing that ?

217
00:19:45,637 --> 00:19:49,338
Combination offactors really.
Uh, no clean clothes.

218
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,310
There never willbe, you know,
unlessyou actually cleanyourclothes.

219
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,821
Right.
Vicious circle.

220
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:58,552
And I was, like,
rooting around in your things...

221
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:00,683
and I found this,
and I thought "cool."

222
00:20:02,314 --> 00:20:04,945
Kinda... spacey.

223
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:10,957
There's something wrong
with the goggles, though.

224
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:13,928
No, they were, um, prescription.

225
00:20:13,998 --> 00:20:17,630
-Groovy.
-So I could see all the fishes properly.

226
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,331
You should do more
ofthis stuff.

227
00:20:20,441 --> 00:20:24,373
- So, look, any messages today ?
- Yeah, I wrote a couple down.

228
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,844
So there were two.
There were two messages ? Right ?

229
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:33,116
You want me to write down
all your messages ?

230
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:37,318
Okay, who are the ones
that you didn't write down from ?

231
00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:40,669
No. Gone completely.

232
00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:42,670
Oh, no.
There was one from your mum.

233
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,361
She said don't forget lunch,
and her leg's hurting again.

234
00:20:45,471 --> 00:20:48,002
- No one else ?
-Absolutely no one else.

235
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:54,745
Though ifwe're going for this obsessive
writing down all the message thing,

236
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:58,256
some American girl called Anna
called a few days ago.

237
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,730
- What did she say ?
- Well, it was genuinely bizarre.

238
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,272
She said, "Hi. It's Anna."
Then she said, "Call me at The Ritz"...

239
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:15,834
and then gave herself
a completely different name.

240
00:21:15,914 --> 00:21:19,855
- Which was ?
- Absolutely no idea.

241
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:22,356
Remembering one name's hard enough.

242
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,687
No, I-- I know that.
She-- She said that.

243
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:27,028
Um, I know she's using another name.

244
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:30,560
The problem is
she left the message with my flatmate...

245
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,571
which was a very serious mistake.

246
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:36,942
Um, I don't know. Imagine, ifyou will,
the stupidest person you've ever met.

247
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:41,244
- Are you doing that ?
- Yes, sir, I have him in my mind.

248
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:44,615
And now double it.
And that is the, um-- what can I say--

249
00:21:44,726 --> 00:21:47,247
the git that I am living with.

250
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:48,727
And he can't remember--

251
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:51,888
- Try Flintstone.
- I'm sorry, what ?

252
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:55,430
I think she said
her name was Flintstone.

253
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:02,433
I don't-- I don't suppose, um,
Flintstone rings any bells, does it ?

254
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:05,784
- Oh, I'll put you right through, sir.
- Oh, my God.

255
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:11,587
Hello. Hi.

256
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:13,597
- Hi there.
- Hello ?

257
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:19,430
- Sorry. It's William... Thacker.
- Yes ?

258
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,031
Um, we-- I work in a bookshop.

259
00:22:26,052 --> 00:22:29,284
Oh, no, I promise you I've never played
anything cool in my entire life.

260
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:32,845
My flatmate, who'll I'll stab to death
later, never gave me the message.

261
00:22:34,456 --> 00:22:37,057
I don't know.
Perhaps, um,

262
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:41,499
I could drop round
for tea later or something.

263
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,571
Right. Right. Great.

264
00:22:55,054 --> 00:22:57,025
Classic.

265
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:03,868
Classic.

266
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:44,455
- Which floor ?
- Three, please.

267
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:15,627
Uh, are you sure this is--

268
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:18,439
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.

269
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:31,624
- Hi. Hi. I'm Karen.
- Hi.

270
00:24:31,694 --> 00:24:34,215
I'm sorry.
Things are running a little bit late.

271
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:38,387
Here's the, uh, thing.
Do you wanna come this way ?

272
00:24:38,497 --> 00:24:41,198
Through here.

273
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,711
So what did you
think ofthe fi lm ?

274
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:50,582
Yeah, I thought it was fantastic.
I thought it was, uh,

275
00:24:50,682 --> 00:24:54,213
Close Encounters
meetsJean de Florette.

276
00:24:56,324 --> 00:24:58,225
I agree.

277
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:01,236
I'm sorry. I didn't get down
what magazines you're from.

278
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:03,767
- Time Out.
- Great.

279
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:06,868
And you're from ?

280
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,881
Horse & Hound.

281
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:21,885
The name's William Thacker. I think,
actually, she might be expecting me.

282
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:24,766
Oh, okay.
Take a seat and I'll go check.

283
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:31,739
I see you've, uh--
I see you've brought her some flowers.

284
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:38,151
These are for my,
um, grandmother.

285
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:40,982
She's in a hospital
just down the road.

286
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,784
Thought I'd kill two birds
with one stone, you know.

287
00:25:43,894 --> 00:25:47,125
Sure, right.
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:49,926
Which hospital's that ?

289
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:53,598
Do you mind me not saying ?
It's a rather distressing disease.

290
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,768
Name ofthe hospital
kind of gives it away.

291
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,151
Right, uh, Mr. Thacker.
Will you come this way.

292
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:04,622
Right.

293
00:26:04,692 --> 00:26:07,593
You've got five minutes.

294
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:19,538
- Hi.
- Hello.

295
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:23,550
Uh, I brought these, but clearly--

296
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,451
No, they're great.
They're great.

297
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:30,393
Ah, listen,
I'm sorry about not ringing back.

298
00:26:30,493 --> 00:26:32,393
The whole "two-names concept"...

299
00:26:32,493 --> 00:26:34,984
was totally too much for my flatmate's
pea-sized intellect.

300
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:38,906
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
I always pick a... cartoon character.

301
00:26:39,006 --> 00:26:41,167
Last time I was Mrs. Bambi.

302
00:26:44,078 --> 00:26:47,310
- Everything all right ?
- Yes, thankyou.

303
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,181
And you're from, uh,
Horse & Hound.

304
00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,693
Is that so ? Well.

305
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:03,766
So, uh--

306
00:27:06,878 --> 00:27:12,110
Uh, I'll just... fi re away then,
shall I ?

307
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,741
Right.

308
00:27:19,233 --> 00:27:22,524
The fi lm's great, and, um,

309
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:25,595
I just was wondering whether...

310
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:27,796
you ever thought of having, um,

311
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:31,638
more, uh, horses in it.

312
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:38,310
Uh, well, we would have liked to,

313
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,763
but it was, um, difficult,
obviously, being set in space.

314
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:49,105
Space, right, yeah.
Yeah, obviously very difficult.

315
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:52,406
I'm so sorry.
I arrived outside.

316
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:54,447
They thrust this thing
into my hand--

317
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,808
No, it's my fault.
I thought this would all be over by now.

318
00:27:57,918 --> 00:28:00,610
I just wanted to sort ofapologize
for the kissing thing.

319
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,620
I seriously don't know
what came over me.

320
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,682
And I just wanted to make sure
that you were fi ne about it.

321
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:12,124
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely fi ne.

322
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:17,206
Do rememberthat Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about hernextproject...

323
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:21,008
which is, um, shooting
later in the summer.

324
00:28:21,118 --> 00:28:24,549
Ah, yes, excellent.
Excellent.

325
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:33,663
Any horses in that one ?

326
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:39,175
Or hounds for that matter. Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.

327
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:42,037
It takes place on a submarine.

328
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:45,578
Oh. Well, bad luck.

329
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,580
But, um,

330
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,991
ifthere were horses in it,

331
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,652
would you be riding them...

332
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:59,364
or would you be getting, a--
a stunt-horse-double-man-thing ?

333
00:29:01,775 --> 00:29:06,607
I-I'm a complete moron.
I apologize. I--

334
00:29:06,717 --> 00:29:10,578
This is very weird. It's the sort
ofthing that happens in dreams,

335
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:13,249
not in reallife.

336
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,790
I mean, good dreams.
It's a--

337
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,452
It's a dream, in fact,
uh, to see you again.

338
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:24,734
What happens next in the dream ?

339
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:30,947
I suppose in the, uh, dream--

340
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:34,578
dream scenario--
I just, uh,

341
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,809
change my personality...

342
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,580
because you can do that
in dreams and, um,

343
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:46,163
walk overand, uh, kiss thegirl.

344
00:29:46,273 --> 00:29:48,934
But, uh--

345
00:29:56,617 --> 00:30:00,319
Time's up, l'm afraid.
Didyouget whatyou wanted?

346
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,850
- Um, nearly, nearly.
- Well, maybejust one last question.

347
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,581
- Um, nearly, nearly.
- Well, maybejust one last question.

348
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:09,612
- Sure.
- Right, right.

349
00:30:13,264 --> 00:30:16,665
Are you... busy tonight ?

350
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:21,637
- Yes.
- Right. Right.

351
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:27,180
- Come in.
- Well, it was nice to meet you.

352
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,511
Yes, and you.

353
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,022
Surreal... but nice.

354
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:36,493
Thankyou. You are Horse & Hound's
favorite actress.

355
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:40,335
You and Black Beauty...

356
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:42,336
tied.

357
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,379
How was she ?

358
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:52,940
Oh, um, fabulous.

359
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,112
Excellent. Wait a minute.
She tookyour grandmother's flowers.

360
00:30:57,192 --> 00:31:00,723
Uh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.

361
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,894
- Bitch.
- Oh, Mr. Thacker.

362
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:07,406
Mr. Thacker, ifyou'd like to come with
me, we can rush you through the others.

363
00:31:07,506 --> 00:31:08,907
The others ?

364
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:11,568
Mr. Thacker is from Horse & Hound.

365
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:16,980
- How's it going ?
- Very well, thankyou.

366
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,491
Have a seat.

367
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:23,753
Well, did you enjoy the fi lm ?

368
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:26,924
Yes, enormously.

369
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:28,865
- Well, fi re away.
- Right.

370
00:31:30,406 --> 00:31:32,737
Did you enjoy making the fi lm ?

371
00:31:32,837 --> 00:31:36,708
- Yes, I did.
- Good.

372
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:39,249
Any bit in particular ?

373
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:42,451
You tell me what bit
you enjoyed the most,

374
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:45,552
and I'll tell you
if I enjoyed making that bit.

375
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:51,294
Uh, I...

376
00:31:51,404 --> 00:31:54,395
liked the bit in space...

377
00:31:54,475 --> 00:31:56,406
very much.

378
00:31:56,476 --> 00:32:00,068
Didyou identify with the character
you'replaying ?

379
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:13,593
Oh. Why not ?

380
00:32:20,006 --> 00:32:23,677
Because he's playing
a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.

381
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,978
Classic.

382
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,850
So, uh,

383
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,511
is this your fi rst fi lm ?

384
00:32:31,621 --> 00:32:34,462
No. It's my 22nd.

385
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:38,463
Ofcourse it is.
Any favorites among the 22 ?

386
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,835
Working with Leonardo.

387
00:32:41,935 --> 00:32:45,967
- Da Vinci ?
- DiCaprio.

388
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,878
Ofcourse.

389
00:32:48,978 --> 00:32:52,979
And is-- is he your favorite
Italian director ?

390
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:00,653
- Mr. Thacker.
- Oh, no.

391
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,534
- Have you got a minute ?
- No.

392
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:18,920
Um-- Yeah, so the, um--

393
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,262
the-- the thing I was doing tonight,
I'm not doing anymore.

394
00:33:23,362 --> 00:33:25,833
I told them I had
to spend the evening...

395
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:29,704
with Britain's premier
equestrian journalist.

396
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,866
Oh. Well, great.

397
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:35,107
Fantastic.
That's, uh--

398
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:38,448
Oh. Shittity brickitty.

399
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:42,080
It's my sister's birthday. Shit.
We're meant to be having dinner.

400
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,061
- Okay, that's fi ne.
- No. I'm sure I can get out of it.

401
00:33:45,131 --> 00:33:48,592
No, I mean, if it's fi ne with you,
I'll be your date.

402
00:33:50,203 --> 00:33:53,264
You--
You'll be my date...

403
00:33:53,374 --> 00:33:56,065
to my little sister's
birthday party ?

404
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:59,907
- If it's all right.
- Well, yeah, l'm sure it's allright.

405
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,818
My friend Max is cooking,

406
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:04,909
and he is generally acknowledged
to be the worst cook in the world.

407
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:09,431
But, um, you know, you could hide
the food in your handbag or something.

408
00:34:09,491 --> 00:34:13,763
- Okay.
- Okay.

409
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:19,645
- He's bringing a girl ?
- Miracles do happen.

410
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:23,807
- Does the girl have a name ?
- Don't know. Wouldn't say.

411
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:26,618
Oh, Christ !
What is going on in there ?

412
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,489
Oh, God !

413
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,491
Hi. Come on in.
Vague food crisis.

414
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:43,435
Hiya ! Sorry.

415
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:46,446
Theguinea fowlisproving
more complicatedthan expected.

416
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:49,447
- He's cooking guinea-fowl ?
- Don't even ask.

417
00:34:52,488 --> 00:34:55,049
Good Lord,
you're the spitting image of--

418
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,150
Bella, this is Anna.

419
00:34:58,901 --> 00:35:01,022
- Right.
- Okay, crisis over.

420
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,033
Max, this is Anna.

421
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,545
- Hi.
- Hello, Anna--

422
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:10,376
Scott.
Have some wine.

423
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:12,717
Thankyou.

424
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:14,547
I'll get it.

425
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:19,489
Red or white ?

426
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:22,331
- Oh. Hey.
- Hi.

427
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:25,922
- Oh, yes, happy birthday.
- Thankyou.

428
00:35:26,032 --> 00:35:28,233
Look, your brother's
brought this girl.

429
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,744
Hi, guys.

430
00:35:31,074 --> 00:35:33,065
Oh, holy fuck !

431
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:36,616
Hon, this is Anna. Anna, this is Honey.
She's my baby sister.

432
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,707
Oh. Hi.

433
00:35:38,787 --> 00:35:41,689
Oh, God. This is one
ofthose key moments in life...

434
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:44,700
when it's possible
you can be really genuinely cool...

435
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,932
and I-- I'm going to fail
just a hundred percent.

436
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:56,415
I-- I absolutely,
totally and utterly adore you.

437
00:35:56,475 --> 00:36:00,776
And I just think... you are
the most beautiful woman in the world.

438
00:36:00,886 --> 00:36:04,048
And, more importantly,
I genuinely believe,

439
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:09,060
and I've believed for some time now,
that we could be best friends.

440
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:12,101
So what do you think ?

441
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:16,103
Uh, lucky me.

442
00:36:18,073 --> 00:36:20,775
Well, happy birthday.

443
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,917
Oh, you gave me a present.
We're best friends already then.

444
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:28,688
Marry Will. He's a really nice guy.
Then we can be sisters.

445
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:31,129
Well, I'll think about it.

446
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,521
That'll be Bernie.

447
00:36:36,771 --> 00:36:39,032
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

448
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:42,043
Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.

449
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:44,674
- Millions down the drain.
- Well done.

450
00:36:44,784 --> 00:36:47,876
- Bernie, this is Anna.
- Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.

451
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:51,857
-And you.
-Honey bunny, Happy birthday toyou

452
00:36:51,957 --> 00:36:54,718
- Hi, Bella.
- Hi.

453
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:58,460
Um, it-- it-- it's a hat.
You don't have to wear it or anything.

454
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,471
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

455
00:37:04,412 --> 00:37:07,034
- Hi.
- What ?

456
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:09,084
- Wine, Bernie ?
- Mm.

457
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:11,585
You haven't slept with her, have you ?

458
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:14,086
That is a cheap question, and
the answer is, or course, no comment.

459
00:37:14,186 --> 00:37:16,087
- No comment means "yes."
- No, it doesn't.

460
00:37:16,187 --> 00:37:18,088
- Do you ever masturbate ?
- Defi nitely no comment.

461
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:20,819
- You see, it means "yes."
- Oh, my God !

462
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:25,431
So, uh, tell me,
um, Anna, what do you do ?

463
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:29,273
- I'm an actress.
- Oh, splendid.

464
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,374
What do you do ?

465
00:37:31,444 --> 00:37:35,215
I'm actually in the stock market myself,
so, uh, not really similar fields.

466
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:38,416
Though, um-- um, I have done
the odd bit ofamateur stuff.

467
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:42,958
Um-- uh, P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.

468
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:45,689
"Careful there, Vicar."

469
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:49,031
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.

470
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:53,102
- The wages are a scandal, aren't they ?
- They can be.

471
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:55,143
I see friends from university--
clever chaps.

472
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:57,144
Been in the business longer than you.

473
00:37:57,254 --> 00:38:01,986
They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.

474
00:38:02,086 --> 00:38:04,387
You know, it's no life.

475
00:38:04,457 --> 00:38:08,829
- What sort ofacting do you do ?
- Films, mainly.

476
00:38:08,929 --> 00:38:13,801
Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies ?

477
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:18,773
I mean, last fi lm you did,
what did you get paid ?

478
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:21,114
Fifteen million dollars.

479
00:38:22,154 --> 00:38:24,085
Right.

480
00:38:24,155 --> 00:38:28,357
So that's, well, fairly good.

481
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:30,488
Right, lthink we're ready.

482
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,499
Bella, can you tell me
where I can fi nd--

483
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,630
Oh, sorry.
It's down the corridor on the right.

484
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,801
I'll show you.

485
00:38:41,712 --> 00:38:44,203
Quickly, quickly.
Talk very, very quickly.

486
00:38:44,313 --> 00:38:45,874
What are you doing here
with Anna Scott ?

487
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:47,975
- Anna Scott ?
- Yes. Shut up !

488
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:50,046
- What, the fi lm star ?
- Shh !

489
00:38:50,156 --> 00:38:52,717
- Oh, God !
- What ?

490
00:38:52,827 --> 00:38:55,658
- Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.
- What did you say to her ?

491
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:59,190
I don't believe it.
I actually walked into the loo with her.

492
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,141
I was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning herjeans.

493
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:04,642
- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.

494
00:39:04,712 --> 00:39:06,703
So you knew who she was ?

495
00:39:06,743 --> 00:39:09,014
Ofcourse I did, but he didn't.

496
00:39:09,084 --> 00:39:13,185
Well, not instantly, but I-- I--
I got away with it.

497
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:20,998
- What do you think ofthe guinea-fowl ?
- I'm a vegetarian.

498
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,499
Oh, God.

499
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,371
So, how's the guinea-fowl ?

500
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:29,842
Best guinea-fowl
I've ever tasted.

501
00:40:03,636 --> 00:40:07,598
Havingyou here, Anna, firmly
establishes what l've long suspected--

502
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:10,479
that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers.

503
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:13,480
- Shame.
- I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

504
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,951
ln fact, lthinkit's something
we should takepride in.

505
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:20,293
I'm gonna give the last brownie
as a prize...

506
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:22,764
to the saddest act here.

507
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,565
- Uh-oh.
- Bern.

508
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:28,836
Yeah, allright.
Well, obviously, it's me, isn 't it ?

509
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:31,998
I mean, I work in the city in a job
I don't understand,

510
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:34,509
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.

511
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,140
I haven't had a girlfriend since--
well, since puberty.

512
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,281
And... nobody fancies me.

513
00:40:40,361 --> 00:40:42,922
And ifthese cheeks get any chubbier,
they never will.

514
00:40:42,992 --> 00:40:46,794
- Nonsense. I fancy you.
- Really ?

515
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:49,465
Yeah. Orldid
beforeyougotso fat.

516
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:52,476
Yousee.
Andunless l'm much mistaken,

517
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,167
yourjob still pays you
rather a lot of money...

518
00:40:55,277 --> 00:40:57,678
whilst Honey here
earns 20 pence a week...

519
00:40:57,778 --> 00:41:00,549
flogging her guts out
in London's worst record store.

520
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:03,781
Yes ! And I haven't got hair.
I've got feathers.

521
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:07,692
And I've got funny goggly eyes.
And I'm attracted to cruel men.

522
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,323
And, actually,
no one willmarry me...

523
00:41:10,403 --> 00:41:13,525
because, um, my boosies
have actually started shrinking.

524
00:41:13,635 --> 00:41:16,036
- Yousee, it's incrediblysad.
- But on the otherhand,

525
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:17,866
her best friend is Anna Scott.

526
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,418
That's true. I can't deny it.
She needs me. What can I say ?

527
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:26,180
And most of her limbs work, whereas
I'm stuck in this thing day and night,

528
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,251
in a house full of ramps.

529
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:31,222
And to add insult
to serious injury,

530
00:41:31,332 --> 00:41:36,564
I've totally given up smoking,
my favorite thing.

531
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:41,006
And, um, well, the truth is,

532
00:41:41,076 --> 00:41:43,267
we can't have a baby.

533
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:51,050
Oh, Belle.

534
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,581
C'est la vie.

535
00:41:56,262 --> 00:42:00,134
Still, um, we're lucky in lots ofways.

536
00:42:00,234 --> 00:42:03,225
But surely that's worth a brownie.

537
00:42:04,806 --> 00:42:10,078
Well, I don't know.
Look at William.

538
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:13,309
- Veryunsuccessfulprofessionally.
- That's true.

539
00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:18,261
Divorced. Used to be handsome,
now kind ofsquidgy round the edges.

540
00:42:19,462 --> 00:42:22,263
Andabsolutely certain never
to hearfromAnna again...

541
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:25,394
- onceshe's heard that his
nickname atschool was--
- Floppy.

542
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:28,635
You did.
I can't believe it, you did.

543
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:32,107
Thanks very much. Thankyou.
Well, at least I get the last brownie.

544
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:34,118
lthinkso, yes.

545
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:36,148
Well, wait.
What about me ?

546
00:42:37,759 --> 00:42:41,781
I'm sorry ?
You thinkyou deserve the brownie ?

547
00:42:41,861 --> 00:42:46,093
Well, a shot at it at least, huh ?

548
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:49,104
You'll have to prove it.
This is a very, very good brownie.

549
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:51,835
I'm gonna fi ght for it.

550
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:55,276
I've been on a diet
every day since I was 1 9,

551
00:42:55,346 --> 00:42:58,678
which basically means
I've been hungry for a decade.

552
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:04,520
I've had a series of not-nice
boyfriends, one ofwhom hit me.

553
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,651
Uh, andeverytime
lget my heart broken,

554
00:43:07,731 --> 00:43:12,063
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.

555
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:19,236
And... it's taken two rather painful,
um, operations...

556
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,317
to get me looking like this.

557
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:24,508
- Really ?
- Really.

558
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:31,421
Andone day not long from now,
my looks willgo,

559
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:34,362
they will discover I can't act,

560
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:39,274
and I will become
some sad, middle-aged woman...

561
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:44,216
who... looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.

562
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,591
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.

563
00:43:57,372 --> 00:43:59,303
Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.

564
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:04,745
- Thankyou for such a terrific time.
- I'm delighted.

565
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:09,117
- That's a great tie.
- Now you're lying.

566
00:44:09,217 --> 00:44:11,808
Okay, it's true.
I told you I was bad at acting.

567
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:14,319
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, and you. And you.

568
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:17,160
I'll wait until you've gone
before I tell him you're a vegetarian.

569
00:44:21,632 --> 00:44:25,123
- Good night.
- I'm so sorry about the loo thing.

570
00:44:25,243 --> 00:44:27,734
I meant to leave.
I just--

571
00:44:27,814 --> 00:44:30,245
Ring me ifyou want someone
to go shopping with.

572
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:33,847
I know lots of nice, cheap places,
not that money is necessarily--

573
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:35,857
It wasjust so nice to meet you.

574
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,819
- Happy birthday. You're my style guru.
- Thankyou.

575
00:44:38,929 --> 00:44:41,020
- Sorry. Can I just--
- Oh.

576
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,030
- Thanks.
- Leave her.

577
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,031
- Good night, everyone.
- Bye.

578
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:48,032
Max, Belle,
we'll see you in a couple ofdays.

579
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,634
- Thankyou, everybody. Call us.
- Bye, guys.

580
00:44:50,714 --> 00:44:53,375
- Bye, Anna.
- Love your work.

581
00:44:53,475 --> 00:44:55,876
Bye, Hon.

582
00:45:02,328 --> 00:45:06,230
Sorry. They always do that
when I leave the house.

583
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,991
It's a stupid thing.
I hate it.

584
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:22,747
- "Floppy," huh ?
- It's the hair.

585
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:25,258
- Mm-hmm.
- It's to do with the hair.

586
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,160
Why is she in a wheelchair ?

587
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,672
Uh, because she had an accident
about 1 8 months ago.

588
00:45:34,742 --> 00:45:37,903
And the pregnancy thing,
is that to do with the accident ?

589
00:45:38,013 --> 00:45:39,404
You know, I'm not sure.

590
00:45:39,514 --> 00:45:42,775
I don't think they tried for kids
before, as fate would have it.

591
00:45:51,298 --> 00:45:54,290
Do you want to, um--

592
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,531
My place isjust, um--

593
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:59,762
Too complicated.

594
00:45:59,872 --> 00:46:02,133
That's fi ne.

595
00:46:07,085 --> 00:46:09,246
Busy tomorrow ?

596
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:14,758
- I thought you were leaving tomorrow.
- I was.

597
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:19,660
All these streets round here have...

598
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,241
these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle ofthem.

599
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:24,672
- They're like little villages.
- Let's go in.

600
00:46:24,772 --> 00:46:27,333
Ah, no, that's the point.
They're private villages.

601
00:46:27,443 --> 00:46:30,344
Only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in.

602
00:46:30,444 --> 00:46:33,746
Oh. You abide by rules like that ?

603
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:36,157
I don't. No, no.
But others do.

604
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:38,628
I just do what I want.

605
00:46:38,698 --> 00:46:41,629
Um-- Right.

606
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,772
Whoopsidaisies.

607
00:46:47,842 --> 00:46:50,363
What did you say ?

608
00:46:50,473 --> 00:46:53,104
- Nothing.
- Yes, you did.

609
00:46:53,184 --> 00:46:57,315
- No, I didn't.
- You said, "Whoopsidaisies."

610
00:46:57,386 --> 00:47:00,687
No one says, "Whoopsidaisies," do they ?
I mean, unless they're--

611
00:47:00,797 --> 00:47:04,128
There is no "unless." Because no one
has said "Whoopsidaisies" for 50 years.

612
00:47:04,198 --> 00:47:08,070
And even then it was-- it wasjust
little girls with blonde ringlets.

613
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,332
Exactly. Right.
So here we go again.

614
00:47:14,242 --> 00:47:17,184
Oh ! Oh ! Whoopsidaisies.

615
00:47:18,754 --> 00:47:21,375
Yeah, well, it's a disease.
It's a clinical thing.

616
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:25,217
I'm taking pills and having injections.
And I'm told it won't last long.

617
00:47:25,327 --> 00:47:28,258
- Okay, stand aside.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

618
00:47:28,368 --> 00:47:31,359
Really, it's quite, um, tricky.
Anna.

619
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,202
Anna, don't. It's harder than it--
No, it's not. It's easy.

620
00:47:45,285 --> 00:47:47,226
Come on, Flopsy.

621
00:47:47,286 --> 00:47:49,457
Right.

622
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:52,048
All right.

623
00:47:52,128 --> 00:47:56,090
Oh, bugger.

624
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,701
Oh, God,
this could be very unpleasant.

625
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:07,214
Ay !
Bugger, bugger.

626
00:48:10,756 --> 00:48:16,068
Now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile ?

627
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,054
Nice garden.

628
00:49:04,438 --> 00:49:07,369
"ForJune who loved this garden.

629
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:10,770
FromJoseph who always sat beside her."

630
00:49:14,482 --> 00:49:17,813
Some people do spend
their whole lives together.

631
00:49:52,267 --> 00:49:54,208
Come and sit with me.

632
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:09,624
Bollocks ! Bollocks !

633
00:50:09,724 --> 00:50:12,596
- Have you seen my glasses ?
- No, afraid not.

634
00:50:12,696 --> 00:50:16,867
Big, big bollocks !
Average day, my glasses are everywhere.

635
00:50:16,937 --> 00:50:19,368
Everywhere I look
there's a pair of glasses.

636
00:50:19,438 --> 00:50:22,139
But when I want to go to the cinema,
they've vanished.

637
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:24,150
It's one of life's real cruelties.

638
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,712
That's compared to, like,
earthquakes in the Far East
or testicular cancer, is it ?

639
00:50:27,782 --> 00:50:30,123
Oh, shit.
Is that the time ?

640
00:50:30,223 --> 00:50:33,784
Thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing.

641
00:50:33,894 --> 00:50:36,225
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you fi nd them ?

642
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:38,266
- Sort of.
- Great.

643
00:51:08,478 --> 00:51:10,379
So who left who ?

644
00:51:10,479 --> 00:51:13,350
- Uh, she left me.
- Why ?

645
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,722
- She saw through me.
- Uh-oh.

646
00:51:16,822 --> 00:51:17,222
That's not good.

647
00:51:17,222 --> 00:51:20,123
That's not good.

648
00:51:20,193 --> 00:51:22,394
You can give me
Anna Scott any day.

649
00:51:22,494 --> 00:51:25,395
I didn't like her last fi lm. Fell asleep
as soon as the lights went down.

650
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:27,406
I don't really care
what the fi lm's like.

651
00:51:27,506 --> 00:51:30,197
Any fi lm with her in,
it's fi ne by me.

652
00:51:32,248 --> 00:51:34,409
She's not my type at all.
lpreferthe otherone.

653
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:37,010
You know, blonde, sweet-looking.

654
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,021
You know, what's-her-name.

655
00:51:39,091 --> 00:51:41,382
Has an orgasm every time
you take her out for a cup ofcoffee.

656
00:51:41,492 --> 00:51:43,583
Meg Ryan.

657
00:51:43,693 --> 00:51:47,094
No, she's too wholesome.
Thepoint about Miss Scott is...

658
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:50,105
she's got that twinkle in her eyes.

659
00:51:50,206 --> 00:51:52,867
Probably drug-induced.
Spends most of her life in bloody rehab.

660
00:51:52,937 --> 00:51:55,538
Well, whatever.
She's so clearly up forit.

661
00:51:55,608 --> 00:51:58,549
Yousee, mostgirls, they're alllike,
"Stay away, chum. "

662
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,711
ButAnna,
she is absolutelygagging forit.

663
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,263
Doyou knowthat in over50.%
ofthe languages,

664
00:52:07,363 --> 00:52:11,124
the wordfor "actress"is
thesame as the wordfor "prostitute" ?

665
00:52:11,234 --> 00:52:13,865
Where didyouget that from ?

666
00:52:13,935 --> 00:52:18,597
AndAnna isyourdefinitive actress,

667
00:52:18,707 --> 00:52:22,479
someone really filthy
you canjust flip overandstart again.

668
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:27,321
- Right, that's it. Sorry.
- No, no. There's really no point.

669
00:52:30,292 --> 00:52:32,493
Um, sorry--
sorry to disturb you guys.

670
00:52:32,593 --> 00:52:34,994
- But, um--
- Can I help ?

671
00:52:35,104 --> 00:52:38,625
Well, yeah. I wish I hadn't overheard
your conversation, but I did.

672
00:52:38,735 --> 00:52:41,296
And, um, I just think, you know,

673
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:44,308
thepersonyou're talking about
is a realperson.

674
00:52:44,408 --> 00:52:47,349
And I think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration...

675
00:52:47,449 --> 00:52:50,110
rather than havingjerks like you
drooling over her.

676
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:52,851
Oh, sod off, mate.
What are you, her dad ?

677
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:02,865
- I'm sorry.
- No, I love that you tried.

678
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:05,837
Time was I'd have done the same thing.
In fact--

679
00:53:10,819 --> 00:53:12,719
Hi.

680
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,211
Oh, my God.

681
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:18,812
I just wanted to apologize for
my friend. He's very sensitive.

682
00:53:18,892 --> 00:53:20,362
Uh, look, I'm sorr--

683
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:23,364
No, no, leave it. It's, you know--
I'm sure you didn't mean any harm.

684
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:25,905
I'm sure it wasjust friendly banter.

685
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:28,906
I'm sure you guys have dicks
the size of peanuts. Enjoy your dinner.

686
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:31,997
The tuna's really good.

687
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,720
I shouldn't have done that.
I shouldn't have done that.

688
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,721
- No, you were brilliant.
- I'm rash and I'm stupid.

689
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:43,882
What am I doing with you ?

690
00:53:43,992 --> 00:53:46,593
Uh, I don't know, I'm afraid.

691
00:53:46,703 --> 00:53:48,604
I don't either.

692
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:55,707
Here we are.

693
00:53:55,777 --> 00:53:57,718
Yes.

694
00:53:59,248 --> 00:54:01,579
- Well, look--
- Do you wanna come up ?

695
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:08,762
Well, there seems to be...
lots of reasons why I shouldn't, so--

696
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,764
There are lots of reasons.

697
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:18,276
Do you wanna come up ?

698
00:54:21,718 --> 00:54:23,909
Give me five minutes ?

699
00:54:46,018 --> 00:54:49,349
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.

700
00:54:49,459 --> 00:54:51,450
- You've got to go.
- Why ?

701
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,662
Because my boyfriend who was in America
is, in fact, now in the next room.

702
00:54:56,762 --> 00:54:58,963
- Boyfriend ?
- Yes.

703
00:54:59,033 --> 00:55:02,634
- Baby, who is it ?
- Uh, it's, uh--

704
00:55:03,705 --> 00:55:06,506
- Uh--
- Uh, room service.

705
00:55:06,616 --> 00:55:11,208
Oh. How you doing ? I thought you guys
always wore those, uh, penguin coats.

706
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:14,219
Usually we do.

707
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:17,160
But I wasjust, uh--
just changed to go home.

708
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,462
And, um, then I thought
I'd take this fi nal call.

709
00:55:21,532 --> 00:55:24,233
Oh, great. Ifyou don't mind,
I would like something too.

710
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:26,894
Could you bring me up some
really, really cold water ?

711
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:29,375
I'll see what I can do.

712
00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:33,887
- Still, not sparkling.
- Absolutely. Ice-cold still water.

713
00:55:33,987 --> 00:55:37,389
Unless it's illegal in the U.K. to serve
beverages below room temperature.

714
00:55:37,489 --> 00:55:41,360
I wouldn't want you going tojail
just to satisfy my whim, now.

715
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,221
- No, I'm sure it's fi ne.
- Thankyou.

716
00:55:44,702 --> 00:55:46,162
Hey, one more thing.

717
00:55:46,232 --> 00:55:48,723
Could you adios these dirty dishes
and take out that trash too ?

718
00:55:51,745 --> 00:55:53,675
- Uh--
- Right.

719
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:56,176
No. No. Um, don't-- don't--
don't do that.

720
00:55:56,246 --> 00:55:58,617
I don't think
it's hisjob to clear.

721
00:55:58,717 --> 00:56:02,919
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
What'syourname, man ?

722
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,130
Bernie.

723
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:08,421
Oh, listen, Bernie.

724
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,803
Thankyou.
I really appreciate it.

725
00:56:11,903 --> 00:56:13,804
Hey, you.

726
00:56:18,245 --> 00:56:23,147
So, tell me. Tell me, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise ?

727
00:56:23,257 --> 00:56:26,049
- Good surprise.
- Oh, you're such a liar.

728
00:56:26,129 --> 00:56:28,560
She hates surprises.
Hey, what areyougonna order?

729
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,561
- Huh ?
- From him. What are you gonna order ?

730
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:33,902
Um, I haven't decided yet.

731
00:56:33,972 --> 00:56:36,133
Oh, well, don't overdo it.

732
00:56:36,243 --> 00:56:40,264
I don't want people saying,
"There goes that famous actor
with the big, fat girlfriend."

733
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:44,636
I should leave.

734
00:56:50,859 --> 00:56:54,320
This is a fairly strange reality
to be faced with.

735
00:56:55,671 --> 00:56:57,632
I'm so sorry.

736
00:57:00,343 --> 00:57:02,634
I don't know...

737
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:05,005
what to say.

738
00:57:05,115 --> 00:57:07,346
Well,

739
00:57:07,446 --> 00:57:09,546
I think, um,

740
00:57:09,656 --> 00:57:12,848
"good-bye" is traditional.

741
00:59:15,578 --> 00:59:17,919
Come on.

742
00:59:18,019 --> 00:59:20,890
Open up.

743
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,561
This is me.
Spikey.

744
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:24,722
This is me.
Spikey.

745
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:30,494
I'm in contact with some quite
important spiritual vibrations.

746
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:36,006
Come on.
Hit me with it.

747
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:42,619
- There's this girl--
- Aha.

748
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,521
See, I been gettin' a female vibe.
Good.

749
00:59:46,591 --> 00:59:49,222
Speak on, dear friend.

750
00:59:49,292 --> 00:59:51,853
She's someone who...

751
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:55,024
can't be mine, and, uh,

752
00:59:57,245 --> 01:00:02,707
it's as if I've taken love heroin,
and now I can't ever have it again.

753
01:00:02,777 --> 01:00:05,979
I've opened Pandora's box
and there's trouble inside.

754
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:12,581
Yeah.

755
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:15,263
Tricky.

756
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,263
Tricky.

757
01:00:19,504 --> 01:00:22,736
I knew a girl at school
called Pandora.

758
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:28,608
Never got to see her box or--

759
01:00:28,688 --> 01:00:30,619
Right.

760
01:00:30,689 --> 01:00:34,420
Right. Thanks. That's very helpful.

761
01:00:36,191 --> 01:00:39,793
You didn't know
she had a boyfriend ?

762
01:00:42,434 --> 01:00:44,374
Why ? Did you ?

763
01:00:45,945 --> 01:00:48,106
Oh, bloody hell.
ldon't believe it.

764
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:52,308
My whole life ruinedbecause
ldon't read Hello magazine.

765
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:56,219
Let's face facts.
This was always a no-win situation.

766
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:00,181
Anna's... a goddess.

767
01:01:00,301 --> 01:01:03,322
You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.

768
01:01:03,402 --> 01:01:06,203
- Buggered, is it ?
- Every time.

769
01:01:06,303 --> 01:01:11,175
But don't despair. lthinklhave
thesolution toyourproblems.

770
01:01:11,245 --> 01:01:14,007
- Really ?
- Mm-hmm. Her name is Tessa.

771
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,917
She works in the Contracts Department.

772
01:01:16,017 --> 01:01:19,319
The hair, I admit,
is unfashionably frizzy,

773
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:23,350
but she's bright as a button and kisses
like a nymphomaniac on death row.

774
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,731
Apparently.

775
01:01:28,272 --> 01:01:30,894
Now... try.

776
01:01:33,945 --> 01:01:36,106
lgot completely lost.

777
01:01:36,216 --> 01:01:38,877
lt's verydifficult, isn 't it ?
Everything'sgot the word
"Kensington"in it.

778
01:01:38,947 --> 01:01:42,358
Kensington Park Road. Kensington Garden.
Kensington bloody Park Garden.

779
01:01:42,418 --> 01:01:44,919
- Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.
- Hello.

780
01:01:45,029 --> 01:01:47,090
- You're in a wheelchair.
- That's right.

781
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,601
And this is William.

782
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:52,032
- Hello, William.
- Hi.

783
01:01:52,102 --> 01:01:55,133
- Max has told me everything about you.
- Has he ?

784
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:57,875
Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.

785
01:01:57,945 --> 01:02:00,246
- Wine ?
- Oh, yes, please.

786
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:02,376
Come on, Willie.
Let's get sloshed.

787
01:02:02,446 --> 01:02:04,477
- Red or white ?
- Red.

788
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:09,489
Keziah.

789
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,261
- Some woodcock ?
- No, thankyou. I'm a fruitarian.

790
01:02:18,273 --> 01:02:21,074
What is a fruitarian, exactly ?

791
01:02:21,144 --> 01:02:24,946
We believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings,

792
01:02:25,016 --> 01:02:27,317
so we think cooking is cruel.

793
01:02:27,417 --> 01:02:31,418
We only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush,

794
01:02:31,488 --> 01:02:33,689
that are, in fact, dead already.

795
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:39,762
Ah. Oh, right.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
